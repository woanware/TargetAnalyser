# TargetAnalyser

## Info ##

TargetAnalyser is basically a rip off of [Automater](http://www.tekdefense.com/automater/), which is a python script designed to perform URL/Domain, IP Address, and MD5 Hash OSINT tool aimed at making the analysis process easier for intrusion Analysts. 

The issue for me is that sometimes I want to look at the page that produced the output, so a UI provides an easy way to get all the info and yet still provide a quick method to open the page. I have also added a lot more OSINT.

All of the input sources are controlled via the **Inputs.xml** file which is located in the application directory. An example of the configured inputs is shown in the **Inputs** screenshot below.

The inputs use regular expressions to extract information from a HTTP response. There are various options that can be set for the input source; these options are detailed in the **configuration** document.

## Features ##

- Easy to add new sources
- Supports IP, Domain, URL and MD5 lookups
- File input data supported
- Trivially open the web page for the data
- Can show the HTTP response to fix regular expression issues
- Has 20 defined input sources (as of v1.0.0 release)

## API Keys 

Each of the **inputs** can use an API key defined in the **ApiKeys.xml** file, located in the application directory. There are two initial defined VirusTotal (VT) and Google SafeBrowsing (GSB), so to use the VT and GSB functionality you need to register with the services and set the API key in the file
